# Test data origins

The test fastq files originate from Ortmann et al 2021 Nature Genetics (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-021-00887-y for the paper and https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE169087 for the data).

WT and WT hypoxia R1/2 reads were downsampled to 0.5M reads each. See `downsample_fastq.sh`.
