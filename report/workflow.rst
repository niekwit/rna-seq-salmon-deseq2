This workflow performs differential expression analysis on paired-end RNA-seq data. After adapter removal with [trim_galore](https://github.com/FelixKrueger/TrimGalore), reads were mapped and transcript counts were generated with [Salmon](https://salmon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/salmon.html). Integrated normalization and differential expression analysis was conducted with [DESeq2](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html) following the standard procedure as outlined in the manual.
